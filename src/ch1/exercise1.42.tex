This problem is a simple application of the connection formulae \refeq{1}{113} and \refeqsub{1}{122} with $f(x) = x$.

\begin{enumerate}[wide, labelindent = 0pt, label = (\alph*)]
	\item Here, we use \refeq{1}{122} with $\phi = 0$.
	      \[
		      \therefore y \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} {(-x)}^{-\frac{1}{4}}} \exp\left( \frac{2}{3} {(-x)}^{\frac{3}{2}} \right)
	      \]
	\item Here, we use \refeq{1}{113}.
	      \[
		      \therefore y \sim \frac{2}{x^{\frac{1}{4}}} \cos\left( \frac{2}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}} - \quarterpi \right)
	      \]
	\item This problem is not defined, as explained after \refeq{1}{122}.
	      In short, the large exponential alone cannot determine the phase.
