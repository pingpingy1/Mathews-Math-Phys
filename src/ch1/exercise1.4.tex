We first seek the complementary solutions.
\[
	y_{c}' + y_c \cos x = 0
	\Rightarrow \frac{dy_c}{y_c} + \cos x dx = 0
	\Rightarrow y_{c} = Ce^{-\sin x}
\]

For the particular solution, we first observe that $\half \sin 2x = \sin x \cos x$.
Thus, we shall try the ansatz $y_p = \sin x + A$.
\[
	\cos x + (\sin x + A) \cos x = \sin x \cos x
	\Rightarrow A = -1
\]
\[
	\therefore y = Ce^{-\sin x} + \cos x - 1
\]
