We first acknowledge that $y=0$ is a solution, so we seek solutions that are not identically zero.

Let $y = xv$.
\[
	y' = v + xv'
	\Rightarrow x^2 (v + xv') + x^2 v^2 = x \cdot xv \cdot (v + xv')
\]
\[
	\Rightarrow v + xv' = xvv'
	\Rightarrow \left( 1 - \frac{1}{v} \right) dv = \frac{1}{x} dx
	\Rightarrow v - \ln v = \ln x + C
\]
\[
	\therefore \frac{y}{x} - \ln y = C
\]
