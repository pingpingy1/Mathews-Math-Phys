From the WKB method followed the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition:
\[
	\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \sqrt{E - V(x)} = \left( n + \half \right) \pi.
\]
($\hbar = 1$ in this unit system.)

If the particle has a total energy of $E < 0$, it then has classical turning points at $\pm a \left( 1 + \frac{E}{V_0} \right)$.
Hence,
\[
	\left( n + \half \right) \pi
	= 2 \int_0^{a \left( 1 + \frac{E}{V_0} \right)} dx \sqrt{V_0 + E - \frac{V_0 x}{a}}
	= \frac{4a}{3V_0} {\left( V_0 + E \right)}^{3/2}
\]
\[
	\Rightarrow {\left( V_0 + E_n \right)}^{3/2} = \left( n + \half \right) \frac{3\pi V_0}{4a}
\]
\[
	\therefore E_n = -\left(
		V_0 - {\left( \left( n + \half \right) \frac{3\pi V_0}{4a} \right)}^{2/3}
	\right)
\]
Here, $n$ takes nonnegative integers as its value such that $E_n < 0$.
