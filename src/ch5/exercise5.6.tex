I'm not quite sure how much rigor one can show this correspondence with.
My argument is something that goes like this:
Suppose the potential of this situation is the stream function of another.
This means that on the real axis, the field lines should be perfectly horizontal,
with discontinuities at precisely $x = \pm a$.
This exact situation is described by two line charges at $x = \pm a$.
Therefore, by the \urlfoot{%
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace\%27s_equation\#Electrostatics_2%
}{``boundary conditions pin down the potential'' lemma},
these two situations (OP and the two line charges) precisely correspond
by exchanging the potential and the stream functions.

The above argument allows us to write
\[
    F(z) := C_1 \ln (z - a) + C_2 \ln (z + a)
\]
where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are real constants to be determined and
\begin{align*}
    \phi(x, y)
    &= \Im F(z) \\
    &= C_1 \Im \ln(x - a + iy) + C_2 \Im \ln(x + a + iy) \\
    &= C_1 \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x - a} + C_2 \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x + a}.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the boundary conditions imply $C_1 = -C_2 = \frac{V_0}{\pi}$, giving
\[
    \phi(x, y)
    = \frac{V_0}{\pi} \left( \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x - a} - \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x + a} \right).
\]

\item
Place the origin at the lower left corner of the metal plate
and promptly disregard the $2$ in the denominator\footnote{%
If anyone knows why the $2$ appears here, please let me know!
I honestly have no clue.
}, that is, let
\[
    \zeta
    := \cosh \frac{\pi z}{d}
    = \cosh\frac{\pi x}{d} \cos\frac{\pi y}{d} + i\sinh\frac{\pi x}{d} \sin\frac{\pi y}{d}.
\]
The given conformal transformation will then map the plate to the upper half plane,
with boundary conditions
\[
    T(x, 0) = \begin{cases}
        0   & (x < -1) \\
        T_0 & (-1< x < 1) \\
        0   & (x > 1)
    \end{cases}.
\]
To convince ourselves of this fact, consider tracing out the boundary of the plate.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The point $(x, 0)$ is mapped to $(\cosh \frac{\pi x}{d}, 0)$,
    which traces out the real interval $(1, \infty)$.

    \item The point $(0, y)$ is mapped to $(\cos \frac{\pi y}{d}, 0)$,
    which traces out the real interval $(-1, 1)$.

    \item The point $(x, d)$ is mapped to $(-\cosh \frac{\pi x}{d}, 0)$,
    which traces out the real interval $(-\infty, -1)$.

\end{itemize}
\begin{align*}
    \therefore T(x, y)
    &= \frac{T_0}{\pi} \left(
        \frac{\Im\zeta}{\Re\zeta - 1} - \tan^{-1} \frac{\Im\zeta}{\Re\zeta + 1}
    \right) \\
    &= \frac{T_0}{\pi} \left(
        \frac{\sinh\frac{\pi x}{d}\sin\frac{\pi y}{d}}{\cosh\frac{\pi x}{d}\cos\frac{\pi y}{d}-1}
        - \frac{\sinh\frac{\pi x}{d}\sin\frac{\pi y}{d}}{\cosh\frac{\pi x}{d}\cos\frac{\pi y}{d}+1}
    \right)
\end{align*}

\end{enumerate}
