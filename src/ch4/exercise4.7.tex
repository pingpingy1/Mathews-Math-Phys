It is 0. It is just 0. No doubt.

You need an explanation?
The integrand is identically zero on the integration range $[0, \pi] \times [1, 2]$.
Just look! Never are both of the arguments to the delta functions zero.

Fine, I'll give a formal proof. It's really no need, you see.
\begin{align*}
    I
    &:= \int_0^\pi dx \int_1^2 dy \delta\left( \sin x \right) \delta\left( x^2 - y^2 \right) \\
    &= \int_0^\pi dx \delta\left( \sin x \right) \left(
        \indicator{x \in [1,2]} \cdot \evalAt{\inv{\abs{-2y}}}{y = x}
        + \indicator{x \in [1,2]} \cdot \evalAt{\inv{\abs{-2y}}}{y = -x}
    \right) \\
    &= 0
\end{align*}
Here, $\indicator{p}$ equals 1 if $p$ is true and 0 if false.
