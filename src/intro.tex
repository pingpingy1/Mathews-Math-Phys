This document is an archive of my solutions to J. Mathews and R. L. Walker's ``Mathematical Methods of Physics'' textbook.
None of the solutions have been verified by anyone other than myself, whom I do not consider a reliable source.
Hence, it is strongly advised against to use this solution for any application where accuracy matters,
especially for assignments and any academic work.
However, I have not yet been able to find any other solutions.
Please just use this manual as just a suggestion.
If you spot any mistakes, please report them to the Github repository.
