This document is an archive of my solutions to J. Mathews and R. L. Walker's ``Mathematical Methods of Physics'' textbook.
None of the solutions have been verified by anyone other than myself, whom I do not consider a reliable source.
Hence, it is strongly advised against to use this solution for any application where accuracy matters,
especially for assignments and any academic work,
not to mention the ethical implications of such actions where it could be considered as cheating.
However, I have not yet been able to find any other solutions.
Please use this manual as just a suggestion.
If you spot any mistakes, please report them to the Github repository.
