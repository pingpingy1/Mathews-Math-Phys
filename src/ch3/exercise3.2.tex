\begin{align*}
	\int_0^\infty dx \sin bx
	 & = \lim_{a \to 0+} \int_0^\infty dx e^{-ax} \sin bx                      \\
	 & = \lim_{a \to 0+} \Im \left\{ \int_0^\infty dx e^{-ax} e^{ibx} \right\} \\
	 & = \lim_{a \to 0+} \Im \left\{ \frac{1}{a - ib} \right\}                 \\
	 & = \lim_{a \to 0+} \frac{b}{a^2 + b^2}                                   \\
	 & = \frac{1}{b}
